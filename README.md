# Coding_Projects
These are a number of coding projects I've worked on sorted by language.

## C++

### Sorting Algorithm Comparison

[Program files](/Sorting_Algorithm_Comparison/)

* Implements various sorting algorithms for a data set of random integers
* Outputs run times of 6 different sorting algorithms on the same data for comparison
* Data set size is determined by user input
* Results


### Record Text File Analyzer

[Program files](/Record_Text_File_Analyzer/)

* Program in C++ to turn text file records to useable data
* Reads a text file, uses a map to store items and quantities sold, and outputs data to a new file
* Displays menu for user with choices for displaying the data in different ways

## Java

### Rescue Animal Record Keeper

[Program files](/Rescue_Animal_Record_Keeper/)

* Defines an animal base class and sub classes for specific animals
* Allows user to perform functions to create new objects and display stored data
* Uses resizable arrays to easily store objects

## Python

### Create Your Own Adventure Game

[Program Files](/Create_Your_Own_Adventure_Game/)

* This is a command line choose your own adventure game written in Python
* Takes input commands to allow user to move between rooms, collect items, and complete an objective
* Main feature is a nested dictionry where:
  * The first keys represent the rooms
  * The value for each room is keys representing an item, moveable directions, and room descriptions with values for each
* Performs input validation
